# Step 1 : Create React Project

Please make a new git repository on your own github space and clone it. (You can make it locally if you want)

Please verify if you have the latest version of NodeJS (`node -v` >= 8.9.3) and NPM (`npm -v` >= 5.6.0)

On your cloned repository, make a new app with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) 
and [react-ats-scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-ats-scripts) :
```shell
npx create-react-app langton-ant-app --scripts-version=react-ats-scripts
```
