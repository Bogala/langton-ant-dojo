![TDD Cycles](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/TDD_Global_Lifecycle.png)
5 Steps to reproduce every cycle:
1. Add a new test
1. Run all tests and verify if the new test fails
1. Write code to pass the new test to green
1. Run all tests and verify all are green
1. Refactor

Before each test, launch a five minutes timer.
* If the code compiles and the tests are green, commit!
* Otherwise, revert!

All of __your__ code must be covered by unit tests.

We'll avoid `any` as much as possible (implicit or not).
